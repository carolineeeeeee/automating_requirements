Overview of our requirement instantiation and checking methods

In this website, we provide the supplementary material for our ICSE'2022 paper.

Please find in the figure below an overview of the approach that we propose and a summary that is linked to the supplementary material sections.

  :alt: 8 transformations included in our experiments

Given (i) a vision task for the MVC, (ii) a safety-related transformation (see :ref:`transformation`) and (iii) experimental data for estimating the ranges of visual changes that do not affect human performance, we provide a process for instantiating machine-verifiable reliability requirements for MVC (see :ref:`estimating`) and a process for checking whether an MVC satisfies these instantiated requirements (see :ref:`checking`).
