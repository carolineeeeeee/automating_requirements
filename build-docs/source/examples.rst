In this website, we provide the supplementary material for our paper.

Please find in the figure below an overview of the approach that we propose.  
Given (i) a vision task for the MVC, (ii) a safety-related transformation and (iii) experimental data for estimating the ranges of visual changes that do not affect human performance, we provide a process for instantiating machine-verifiable reliability requirements for MVC (requirement instantiation) and a process for checking whether an MVC satisfies these instantiated requirements (requirement checking).
